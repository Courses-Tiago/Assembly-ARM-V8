system call table: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/constants/syscalls.md#arm64-64_bit
- The CPU contains internal register or cache memories to facilitate some
    operations and avoid to access the BUS to exchange data to RAM memory.

- Assembly does not contain data types as most of other languages.

- In ARM-V8 a word has 64-bit size and a half-word has 32-bit.

- The 31 general purpose register are from x0 to x30 and have 64-bit size,

ADDRESSING MODES
1 - IMMEDIATE ADDRESSING: Constant value to register, ex: mov x8, #93
2 - DIRECT ADDRESSING: Register value to another Register, ex: mov x0, x1
3 - INDIRECT ADDRESSING:
